Shift Manager app made by Kyle S. Made to display: Competency with React, Typescript, Bootstrap 5, CSS and SASS styling. Passing Props and Types between components to use elsewhere in the codebase. Creating re-useable component libraries and tying them together in a cohesive app view.


Demonostrates base functionality, potential upgrades to add in future:
- MultiPage functionality, I've setup a page selectore but with larger scale data this could be hooked up to work in several pages.
- Live Date tracking, could add in a fifth field to the shiftlist for date's, and use javascript's Date object to put a current date/time in the placeholder?
- More components as needed, perhaps a Search feature for shift name and a filter for group?
